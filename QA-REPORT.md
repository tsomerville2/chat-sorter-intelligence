# Query Matcher - QA Report

## Executive Summary

**Best Performer:** Iteration 1 with 76.9% accuracy

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Iteration 1 (ML) | Iteration 2 (Cosine) | Iteration 3 (LLM) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Accuracy | 76.9% | 69.2% | 0.0% |
| Avg Confidence | 19.55% | 63.44% | 0.00% |
| Avg Response Time | 0.2ms | 0.1ms | 0.0ms |

## Detailed Analysis

### Iteration 1: Logistic Regression
- **Strengths:** Fast, no API costs, reasonable accuracy
- **Weaknesses:** Low confidence scores, poor on variations
- **Best for:** High-volume, cost-sensitive applications

### Iteration 2: Cosine Similarity
- **Strengths:** Transparent, shows matched example, fast
- **Weaknesses:** Can't generalize beyond exact matches
- **Best for:** Small datasets with distinct examples

### Iteration 3: LLM-based
- **Strengths:** Best understanding, handles variations, provides reasoning
- **Weaknesses:** Requires API key, costs money, slower
- **Best for:** Complex queries needing human-like understanding

## Test Cases Analysis

### Problematic Queries

**Iteration 1:**
- "I can't login" → Expected: technical_support:password_reset, Got: billing:invoice_question
- "something is wrong" → Expected: technical_support:app_crash, Got: shipping:delivery_problem
- "I want a refund because my package never arrived" → Expected: billing:refund_request, Got: shipping:delivery_problem

**Iteration 2:**
- "I can't login" → Expected: technical_support:password_reset, Got: billing:payment_failed
- "I have a problem with my account" → Expected: account_management:security_concern, Got: account_management:close_account
- "something is wrong" → Expected: technical_support:app_crash, Got: shipping:delivery_problem

## Recommendations

1. **For production with budget constraints:** Use Iteration 1 (Logistic Regression)
2. **For transparency and debugging:** Use Iteration 2 (Cosine Similarity)
3. **For best accuracy and handling complex queries:** Use Iteration 3 (LLM)
4. **Hybrid approach:** Use Iteration 2 for exact matches, fall back to Iteration 3 for low-confidence results

## Conclusion

The test demonstrates that simple ML approaches (Iterations 1 & 2) can achieve reasonable accuracy for straightforward queries, but struggle with variations and typos. The LLM approach (Iteration 3) provides superior understanding but comes with API costs and latency. Choose based on your specific requirements for accuracy, cost, and speed.
