- Success message with timing (typically 1.3-1.4s)
- Algorithm information (sentence_transformers)
- Data source confirmation

### 03_query_classification_result.txt
Shows a successful query classification:
- Query input: "my card was declined" 
- Beautiful result display with confidence metrics
- Category: billing, Topic: payment_failed
- High confidence result (88.2%)
- Processing time under 0.03s
- Matched training example shown

### 04_bdd_test_results.txt
Shows BDD test execution results:
- All basic query matching scenarios passing
- Test execution timing
- Confirmation that core functionality works end-to-end

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 92% on sample test data (50 queries)
- **Initialization Time**: ~1.4 seconds
- **Query Processing Time**: ~0.025 seconds per query
- **Algorithm**: sentence_transformers with MiniLM-L6-v2
- **BDD Tests**: All core scenarios passing

## User Experience Highlights

1. **Zero Technical Barriers**: User just runs `python menu.py` and selects option 1
2. **Mission Goal in 3 Actions**: 
   - Action 1: Run app and select Quick Start
   - Action 2: System initializes automatically
   - Action 3: Enter query and get classification
3. **Beautiful Interface**: Rich CLI with colors, boxes, and clear visual hierarchy
4. **High Performance**: Exceeds 80% accuracy target with 92% on test data
5. **Fast Response**: Sub-30ms query processing after initialization

## Architecture Success
