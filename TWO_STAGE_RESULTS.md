# Two-Stage Classification Results (play2.C2.py)

## Overview

play2.C2.py implements a two-stage classification approach:
1. **Primary classification** using embeddings (word + char features)
2. **Fallback to top-N** when confidence is below threshold
3. **Success if correct answer is in top-N matches**

## Key Features

- **Confidence Threshold**: Configurable (default 0.35)
- **Top-N**: Number of alternatives to consider (default 2)
- **Fallback Logic**: If confidence < threshold and correct answer is in top-N, count as success

## Test Results

### Quick Test (5 queries)

With default settings (threshold=0.35, N=2):
- **Primary Accuracy**: 80% (4/5)
- **With Fallback**: 100% (5/5)
- **Improvement**: +20%
- Successfully handles "I can't login" via fallback

### 100 Sample Test

With default settings (threshold=0.35, N=2):
- **Primary Accuracy**: 49%
- **With Fallback**: 62%
- **Improvement**: +13%
- Used fallback: 73 times (73% of queries)

### Threshold Optimization

Testing different thresholds on 100 samples:

| Threshold | Primary | w/ Fallback | Improvement | Fallback Usage |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0.20      | 49%     | 50%         | +1%         | 12%            |
| 0.30      | 49%     | 59%         | +10%        | 58%            |
| 0.35      | 49%     | 62%         | +13%        | 73%            |
| 0.40      | 49%     | 64%         | +15%        | 86%            |
| **0.50**  | **49%** | **67%**     | **+18%**    | **98%**        |

**Optimal Configuration**: threshold=0.50, N=2
- Achieves **67% accuracy** (up from 49%)
- Nearly all queries use fallback (98%)

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Approach | Accuracy (100 samples) | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|-------|
| play2.C (Original Embeddings) | 75% | Best single-stage |
| **play2.C2 (threshold=0.50)** | **67%** | Two-stage with fallback |
| play2.C2 (threshold=0.35) | 62% | Default settings |
| play1.A (Enhanced ML) | 51% | Custom features |
| play2.B (Char N-grams) | 49% | Character matching |

## Use Cases

### When to Use play2.C2

1. **Human-in-the-loop systems**
   - Can present top-N options to users
   - "Did you mean..." functionality

2. **Confidence-aware applications**
   - Need to know when the system is uncertain
   - Can escalate low-confidence queries

3. **Flexible accuracy requirements**
   - Can tune threshold for precision vs recall
   - Accept "probably right" answers

### Configuration Guidelines

- **High Precision**: Use low threshold (0.2-0.3)
  - Fewer fallbacks, trust primary more
  - Lower overall accuracy but fewer uncertain cases

- **High Recall**: Use high threshold (0.4-0.5)
  - More fallbacks, consider alternatives
  - Higher accuracy but more uncertainty

- **Balanced**: Use medium threshold (0.35)
  - Default setting, reasonable trade-off

## Implementation Details

```python
# Core logic
if confidence < threshold:
    top_n = get_top_n_matches(query, n=2)
    if correct_answer in top_n:
        count_as_success()
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run with default settings
python play2.C2.py
# Select option 5 for 100-sample test

# Configure optimal threshold
python play2.C2.py
# Select option 3
# Enter 0.5 for threshold
# Enter 2 for top-N

# Compare different thresholds
python play2.C2.py
# Select option 7
```

## Conclusion

The two-stage approach provides a **flexible middle ground** between accuracy and confidence:
- Not as accurate as play2.C (75%) but adds confidence awareness
- Better than base embeddings (49%) when fallback is acceptable
- Perfect for systems that can handle uncertainty or present alternatives

The key insight: **67% accuracy with confidence** may be more valuable than **75% accuracy without** in many real-world applications.
